# HTML Chapter 6: Tables
- table represents information in a grid format
``` html
<table>  <!--create a table-->
  <tr>  <!-- start table row-->
    <th> <!-- table heading-->
      <td> <!--insert table data-->
      </td>
  </th>
  </tr>
</table>
```
- you can make cells of a table span more than 1 row or column using the `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes
- for long tables, you can split the table into a `<thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>`
# JS Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, Objects
- functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task
- functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value
- an object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you
- in an object, variables are known as properties of the the object
  - functions are knows an methods of the object
- web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window
- JS also has internal built-in objects such as `String, Number, Math`, and `Date`
  - their properties and methods offer functionality that helps to write scripts
- arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets 
  -  both can contain the other
