# HTML Chapter 4: Links
### writing links: 
- Linking to other sites: `<a href = "http://www.link.com">Link Title</a>`
- Linking to other pages on same site: `<a href = "index.html">Home<a/>`
- Email links: `<a href = "mailto:jon@example.com">Email Jon</a>`
- Opening links in new window: `<a href = "http://www.link.com" target = "_blank">`
- Linking to parts of same page: use relative links instead of qualified URLs
```
<a href = "#home">Homepage</a>
...
<h2 id = "home">Homepage</a>
```
