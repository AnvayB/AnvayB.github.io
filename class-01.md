# HTML Chapter 1: Structure
1. Tags act as containers of page information
  - html: HTML code
  - body: main browser window
  - h1, h2: subheadings of decreasing size
  - p: paragraph of text
2. Attributes provide information about the contents of an element using a *name* = "*value*" format
  - Ex: img src = "*http link*"
  - Ex: p *lang* = "*en-us*" --> determines the language of the page
3. Body, Head, Title
  - Before the body tag, there are head & title tags
  - Head: contains info about the page
    - essentially just the title section
  - Title: references what text will appear as the title of the window or browser tab
 4. Summary
  - HTML pages are text docs
  - HTML uses tags (angle brackets) to give the info they surround special meaning
  - tags are referred to as elements
  - tags often come in pairs; closing tag has a forward slash after the first angle bracket
  - opening tags can contain attributes, which tell us about the content of the element
  - attributes require a *name* and *value*

# HTML Chapter 8: Extra Markup
1. <!DOCTYPE html> tells browser which version of HTML (HTML5) we're using
  - different tag content for older versions
2. Comments in HTML
  - used to tell yourself and others what a certain block of code does, or where you got it from
3. id Attribute
  - aka global attribute
  - can be used to reference certain elements when styling page in CSS
 4. class Attribute
  - similar to id
  - but used to reference several elements when styling page in CSS
 5. Block Elements
  - elements that will start on a new line
    - Ex: h1, p, li, ul
 6. Inline Elements
  - elements that will continue to appear on the same line as others
    - Ex: a, b, em, img
