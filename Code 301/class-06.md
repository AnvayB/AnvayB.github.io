### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
- Engaged collaboration has been the most helpful for me bc it reduces the pressure from one individual if we run into a problem. 
- With both minds working on the same issue, we are likely to come up with a good solution much faster than if only one person was working on it.
### How does pair programming work?
- With the Driver and the Navigator:
  - Driver:
    - programmer
    - typing code on the keyboard
    - handling the mechanics of coding → text editing, switching files, version control
  - Navigator:
    - guides the Driver with words and explanations
    - doesn't physically interact with the computer
    - has big picture plan
    - scan for typos and bugs, use own computer to search for potential solutions
