### Who is Roy Fielding?
- computer scientist from California who co-created the HTTP specification, REST protocol, and Apache HTTP Server Project
### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
- Because they weren't designed to do that. 
- The techinques created only needed to communicate with a small group of machines, so now we need a way to, 
while still communicating with a small group of machines, have the machines interact with each other and send data amongst themselves.
### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style
### What does a GET do?
- requests data from a resource (server)
### What does a POST do?
- sends data to the server to create/update a resource
### What does PUT do?
- replaces what exits at a URL with something else 
  - used for filling pages with new content without refreshing the entire page
### What does PATCH do?
- supplies some instructions to the  to help modify the resource
